I've made it to the middle of my life or somewhere thereabouts and I've run into what I can only guess is my midlife crisis.  I've got this nagging feeling in the pit of my soul (or whatever it is that us humans have in there) that I've lost my way, or that I'm not happy, or that I'm missing something that I need. I don't fucking know. I can't yet put my finger on what exactly is going on with me or why I'm feeling this way, but I've decided I'm going to try to find out.  

I told my family that I was leaving.  I need a timeout. That's what one of my friends told me to call it, because being a dickhead that just walks out on your wife and kids just doesn't have the same ring to it.  I do plan on coming back home, but I need to figure my shit out before I do.  I start heading West this weekend and I don't even know what it is I'm hoping to find at this point.  I really hope I don't fuck this up.
